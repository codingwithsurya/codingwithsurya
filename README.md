Hey y'all - my name is Surya! I study computer science @ Georgia Tech. My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and systems for both training and inference of foundation models.

Previously, I worked on large-scale distributed systems for feature embedding pipelines that powered ads-related ML models (ranking, retrieval, etc.) at Pinterest. I am currently pursuing research in efficient inference optimizations for mixture-of-expert models and improving reasoning in llms.

If you find any of my projects interesting, feel free to reach out @ ssubrama32@gatech.edu!
