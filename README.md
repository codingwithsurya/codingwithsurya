### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Surya!



- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I was a SWE intern at Pinterest working on a data acquisition -> feature embedding pipeline for ads conversion visibility.
- ðŸ”­ I have a lot of passion for my work, so I end up spending a lot of my free time learning from various sources like Youtube, blogs, twitter, etc. These days, I'm particuarly interested in AI Infrastructure (distributed ML training, HPC) and the latest advancements in AI Research.
