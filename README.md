Hey y'all - my name is Surya! I study computer science @ Georgia Tech. My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and systems. I'm passionate about ML training infrastructure, compilers, inference, distributed systems, and high performance computing for AGI. I have a lot of passion for my work, so I end up spending a lot of my free time learning from various sources like Youtube, blogs, twitter, research papers, etc.

Previously, I created a data acquisition -> feature embedding pipeline for downstream ML models (conversion user match prediction, ads ranking + retrieval, linksage, etc.) at Pinterest. I am currently pursuing research in efficient inference optimizations for mixture-of-expert models and improving reasoning in llms.

If you find any of my projects interesting, feel free to reach out @ ssubrama32@gatech.edu!
