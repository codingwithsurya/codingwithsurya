Hey y'all - my name is Surya. I study computer science @ Georgia Tech. My interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and systems. I'm passionate about ML training infrastructure, compilers, inference, distributed systems, and high performance computing for AGI. I have a lot of passion for my work, so I end up spending a lot of my free time learning from various sources like Youtube, blogs, twitter, research papers, etc. These days, I'm particuarly interested in efficient ML systems for both training and inference of foundation models.

Previously, I created a data acquisition -> feature embedding pipeline for downstream ML models (conversion user match prediction, ads ranking + retrieval, linksage, etc.) at Pinterest. I am currently pursuing research in efficient inference optimizations for mixture-of-expert models and improving reasoning in llms.

For any inquires, feel free to reach out @ ssubrama32@gatech.edu!
