### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Surya!



- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Systems/Architecture. Previously, I was a SWE intern at Pinterest working on a data acquisition -> feature embedding pipeline for ads conversion visibility.
- ðŸ”­ I have a lot of passion for my work, so I end up spending a lot of my free time learning from various sources like youtube, blogs, twitter, research papers, etc. These days, I'm particuarly interested in efficient ml systems for both training and inference of foundation models.
